# Wdâˆ—-test: Robust Distance-Based Multivariate Analysis of Variance
Bashir Hamidi1,  Kristin Wallace,  Chenthamarakshan Vasu, and Alexander V. Alekseyenko

Beta diversity analyses or community-wide ecological analyses are important tools for understanding the differentiation of the entire microbiome between experimental conditions, environments, and treatments. For these analyses, specialized distance metrics are used to capture the multivariate relationships between each pair of sam- ples in the dataset. Analysis of variance-like techniques, such as PERMANOVA [1], may then be used to determine if an overall difference exists between conditions.  The utility of these methods is hard to underestimate as virtually every recent major microbiome report has used some form of a community-wide association analysis.
